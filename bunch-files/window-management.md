Bunch does not have any window management features. This is because there are plenty of dedicated apps that do a far better job than Bunch ever aspires to, and many of them have great automation features that make them perfect for use with Bunch. My favorite example is [using Bunch with Moom]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/integration/moom).

If you're an intrepid hacker, you can also achieve window management and much more [using Hammerspoon]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/integration/hammerspoon).
