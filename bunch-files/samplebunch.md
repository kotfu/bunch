# Some examples to get you started

These are mostly Bunches that I (Brett, the developer) actually use. Several of them incoporate [Embedded Snippets]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/bunch-files/snippets/#embeddedsnippets) in these examples so I don't have to also include all of my snippet files to let you see what's going on. Anything in an Embedded Snippet can also be moved to an external file.

These examples make use of [comments]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/bunch-files/comments/) to explain what's happening.

## Example.bunch

This example demonstrates the basic syntax for a Bunch file.

```
# Comments start with `#` or `//` and a space
# blank lines are ignored

/* 
Comments can also use a block syntax 
for multi-line comments 
*/

/* 
Use @@ to hide all visible apps. Usually used at the top of the 
file before launching the rest of the bunch */
@@

/* Apps to launch start at the beginning of a line, no
need to quote or escape. */
Messages

# Apps launched by a Bunch can be quit when the Bunch is closed
%Terminal // Add a percent symbol to ignore it when quitting (keep it running)

/* Include a line starting with a dash to open specific
   files in the app.
   If the first file listed is "XX", all open windows
   for the app will be closed first */

recognizes will be executed

## Communication Apps

I have this Bunch load on launch. It makes it easy to quit all of these apps at once, and load them back up at my convenience.

## Coding

Here's the Bunch I use when I'm ready to code. It offers a choice of my main projects using [Query Dictionary syntax]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/bunch-files/interactivity/#dictionary). It launches all of the common apps between the projects and tells Bunch not to quit them when the Bunch closes with a `%`. It uses [Embedded Snippets]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/bunch-files/snippets/#embeddedsnippets) to load the appropriate projects, and [Moom]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/integration/moom/) in a [Waiting Snippet]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/bunch-files/snippets/#waitingsnippet) to position the windows according to a snapshot after everything loads.

I have folder sets set up in [Forklift]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/integration/forklift/), with keystrokes assigned that this Bunch sends.
