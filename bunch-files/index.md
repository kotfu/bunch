The Bunch menu is created by reading text files from your [Bunch folder]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/bunch-files/bunch-folder). To show up in the menu, the file just has to have the extension `.bunch`. They contain apps to launch, urls to open, commands to run, and more. Learn more about the syntax and features below.
