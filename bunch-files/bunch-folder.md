# Bunch Folder Setup

By default, Bunch reads plain text files from a folder at `~/Documents/Bunches` (that's a folder called "Bunches" in your Documents folder). You can add a new folder using the __Add__ button next to the Bunch Folder in [Preferences]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/using-bunch/preferences/) (possibly to a Dropbox or iCloud folder where you can sync with other machines). The dropdown menu there will let you switch between any Bunch folders you've added.

> Tip (kinda): when you change the Bunch folder location, it doesn't move or delete any of the Bunches at the previous location. That means that (in a fairly inelegant way) you can use different folders for different sets of Bunches. You can also quickly switch sets using the [setPrefs URL handler]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/integration/url-handler/#urlhandlersetpref) from other apps.
