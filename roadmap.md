# Bunch Roadmap

- [x] Better backgrounding of tasks while still maintaining sequence of execution
- [x] Allow parallel execution?
- [x] Save as Bunch (save currently open apps as a Bunch)
- [x] Probably going to need a preference pane eventually
- [ ] Better means of opening Finder windows in tabs
- [ ] Webhooks: ability to send HTTP POST requests with body in background
- [ ] Allow multiple Waiting snippets (in sequence) for groupings of items within a Bunch
- [ ] If/Then/Else logic
- [ ] Ability to wait for a script, or specific text in the output
- [ ] Configurable colors for ANSI escapes in task monitor

### Someday/Maybe

- [ ] Feedback display for app launches/terminates/Bunch progress
- [ ] Watch files sourced by `from file/script` frontmatter for changes
- [ ] Internal tokenized Bunch editor
