- Use a separator to allow snippets to be defined inside of Bunches
- Watch files sourced by `from file/script` frontmatter for changes
- Option to sort menu by display title
- Probably going to need a preference pane eventually
- Ability to double click bunch files
- Better backgrounding of tasks while still maintaining sequence of execution
    + Related, allow parallel execution?
- Better means of opening Finder windows in tabs

### Someday

- Save as Bunch (save currently open apps as a Bunch)
- Feedback display for app launches/terminates/Bunch progress
- Internal tokenized Bunch editor
