Before contacting me with issues, please visit the [Troubleshooting](/bunch/docs/troubleshooting) page and see if I've already added your issue there. Just in case.

If you need to contact me about an issue, please use the [Discussions site](https://github.com/ttscoff/bunch-docs/discussions) if possible.  If needed, you can also contact me [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/ttscoff) or <a href="javascript:location='mailto:\u006d\u0065\u0040\u0062\u0072\u0065\u0074\u0074\u0074\u0065\u0072\u0070\u0073\u0074\u0072\u0061\u002e\u0063\u006f\u006d';void 0">email me directly</a>.

Obviously I'll be nicer to you if you've [donated](/bunch/donate/)...
