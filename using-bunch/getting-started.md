### Set Your Preferences

To make the most of Bunch, you'll want to set some [Preferences]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/using-bunch/preferences). Most importantly, choose to run Bunch in the Dock or the menu bar, and whether Bunches toggle open and closed. My personal recommendation is to run Bunch in the menu bar, and have "Toggle Bunches" turned on.

### Create Your First Bunch

The first time you run Bunch, a Bunch Folder will be created in your Documents folder. You can change this location, but you probably won't need to. See [The Bunch Folder]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/bunch-files/bunch-folder) for more information.

The Bunch folder contains Bunch files, also called "Bunches." A Bunch file is just a plain text file with the extension `.bunch`. You can edit them in TextEdit (in plain text mode, not Rich Text), or in any text editor.

Each Bunch is a separate file, and the name of the Bunch will be taken from the filename (without the `.bunch` extension). Once you've added your own configuration(s), delete the `Example.bunch` file (or rename it with an extension other than `.bunch`).

The fastest way to create a simple Bunch is to open the apps you want your Bunch to launch and choose "New Bunch With Open Apps" from the [Bunch menu]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/using-bunch/menu). Your new Bunch will show up in the menu immediately, ready to try out. Opening and closing this new Bunch will open and close all of the apps listed in it.

But Bunch can do much more than just launch apps. Take some time to explore [all of the possibilities]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/bunch-files). You don't have to learn it all, you can just look up how to do something as you need it. The [Syntax Reference]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/bunch-files/quick-reference) offers quick reminders for how to accomplish most tasks in a Bunch.
