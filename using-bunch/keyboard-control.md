For people who love keyboard shortcuts, Bunch can accomodate. You have to run in menu bar mode to use keyboard access, so open Preferences and enable "Run in Menu Bar."

Then, in Preferences, assign a hotkey to use to open Bunch. Once this is assigned, you can use it no matter what application you're in. Pick a combination that won't conflict with default app shortcuts. I recommend including Control in the combination which avoids most conflicts.

Once these are set up, hit your hotkey and you'll see that the Bunches listed in the menu have keyboard shortcuts assigned. By default these are numbers. Just type the number of a Bunch to open (or toggle) it. 

You can customize the shortcut for each Bunch with the [`shortcut` frontmatter]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/bunch-files/frontmatter/#shortcuts).
