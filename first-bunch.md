You've just run the example Bunch. This Bunch is really designed to be viewed in your editor rather than running directly. It provides a quick overview of the basic syntax.

You can learn about _all_ of the things you can do in a Bunch by exploring [the Bunch Files documentation!](https://brettterpstra.com/bunch-beta/docs/bunch-files).
