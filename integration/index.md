For advanced usage, there are many ways to extend the power of Bunch for your workflow. Betweeen Bunch's own tools like its URL Handler, AppleScript dictionary, and command line interface to its ability to integrate with some amazing Mac automation tools, there's no limit to what you can do.

For window placement and sizing automation, check out [integration with Moom](/bunch/docs/integration/moom/).
