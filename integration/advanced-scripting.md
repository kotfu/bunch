## Debugging Scripts Run By Bunch

STDOUT and STDERR from scripts run by Bunch are reported in the [Bunch Log]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/using-bunch/bunch-log), if your Log Level is set to Debug (__Help -> Set Log Level__). 

If your script is returning an exit code other than 0 and there's content in STDERR, the script will produce an error in the log. All pertinent error messages will be shown.

You can use the log output to see variables and debugging statements by simply printing/echoing them to STDOUT/STDERR from your script. As long as your script returns a 0 exit code, printing to STDERR won't interrupt Bunch's execution of the script.

Several [environment variables]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/bunch-files/scripts/shell-scripts#argsandenv) are sent to any script run by Bunch. You can see this in the log by having your script execute `/usr/bin/env`. The output will go to STDOUT and be visible in the log.

## Getting the Bunch Folder in a Script {#bunchfolder}

You can access various preferences from the command line using `defaults`. The following will return the current location of your Bunch files:

    defaults read com.brettterpstra.bunch configDir

Getting a list of available bunches is as easy as doing an `ls *.bunch` on that folder.

You can also check the "Toggle Bunches" and "Single Bunch Mode" settings:

```bash
defaults read com.brettterpstra.bunch toggleBunches
defaults read com.brettterpstra.bunch singleBunchMode
```

You can also use the [Bunch CLI]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/integration/cli/) to query specific keys.

```bash
$ bunch --show-config-key dir
/Users/username/bunches

$ bunch --show-config-key toggle
true
```

## Selecting A Spotify Playlist

Here's an example using `from script` frontmatter to let you pick from your favorite Spotify playlists or perform a Spotify search.

The script is in JavaScript (for Automation) and saved in a `scripts` folder inside my Bunch folder. I can reference it with the relative path `scripts/ChoosePlaylist.applescript`. 

The script would take some modification with your own playlists and titles, but would be easy to change:

```js
#!/usr/bin/osascript -l JavaScript

var app = Application.currentApplication()
app.includeStandardAdditions = true
     
var playlists = {
	"Mellow": "spotify:playlist:37i9dQZF1E35F7NsH3aWbs",
	"Pop": "spotify:playlist:37i9dQZF1E39mpAvbgovri",
	"Punk": "spotify:playlist:37i9dQZF1E3930Ag6USpnA",
	"Indie": "spotify:playlist:37i9dQZF1E39UzhnpcOJqd",
	"Metal": "spotify:playlist:37i9dQZF1E35o96rAfTenf",
	"Rock": "spotify:playlist:37i9dQZF1E38gxK1HWfQU0",
	"Search": ""
}


var list = app.chooseFromList(Object.keys(playlists), {
	withPrompt: "What to play?",
    defaultItems: ["Search"]})[0];

if (list === undefined) {
	'spotify url: spotify:'
} else if (playlists[list] === "") {
  var search = app.displayDialog("What to search for?", {
    defaultAnswer: "",
    buttons: ["Cancel", "Search"],
    defaultButton: "Search"
  });
  `spotify url: spotify:search:${encodeURIComponent(search.textReturned)}`
} else {
  `spotify url: ${playlists[list]}`
}
```

The above script offers a list with the keys from the `playlists` object. If you cancel, it outputs Spotify's base url handler, 'spotify:'. If you select "Search," it pops up a second dialog asking for a search string, then formats that into a URL encoded Spotify URL for searching. If you pick a playlist, it returns the value for that key, which is already a full Spotify URI.

Now create a Bunch that just contains:

```bash
---
title: ðŸŽµListen
from script: scripts/ChoosePlaylist.applescript
---
Silicio
<<#Search Spotify
___
---[Search Spotify]---
Spotify
- ${spotifyurl}
```

When the Bunch is opened, it runs the above script and stores the `spotifyurl` variable. The embedded snippet launches Spotify and passes the URL to it. Having Silicio and Spotify in the Bunch means that when I close it, both apps quit, making music listening easy to manage. You could also add automation for setting audio devices and volumes, running Moom to position windows, etc.

```
---
title: ðŸŽµListen
from script: scripts/ChoosePlaylist.applescript
---
(audio output Komplete Audio)
Silicio
<<#Search Spotify
___
-[Search Spotify]
Spotify
- ${spotifyurl}
# Alternatively to the file parameter, 
# you could use this to start playing immediately:
# * tell app "Spotify" to play track "${spotifyurl}"
```

## Adding a User Input Dialog {#password}

You can use the `from script` [frontmatter]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/bunch-files/frontmatter#dynamicfrontmatter) to implement a password dialog that can be passed on to your scripts. This could, for example, allow you to automate unlocking a keychain and getting a secure password for a scripted curl call. It also serves as an example of just getting interactive input for a script and could be applied to select dialogs, file select dialogs, and more.

1. Create a script that uses AppleScript to show a dialog. This can be done in an actual AppleScript, or in a shell script that calls `osascript`. Here's a ruby example:
	
	```ruby
	#!/usr/bin/env ruby
	require 'yaml'
	
	password = %x{osascript <<'APPLESCRIPT'
	  return text returned of (display dialog "Enter password" default answer "" buttons {"Cancel", "OK"} default button 2 with hidden answer)
	APPLESCRIPT}.strip
	
	puts YAML.dump({'password' => password})
	```
	
	This displays a secure input dialog (secure in that the input is hidden) and returns the response formatted as YAML.
2. Save the script in your Bunch folder as `mypasswordscript.rb`. Make the script executable (`chmod a+x mypasswordscript.rb`) and you can call it from a Bunch's frontmatter:

	```	
	---
	from script: mypasswordscript.rb
	---
	```

	When the Bunch is opened, the result of the above script will be read in and appended to the Bunch's frontmatter.

3. Now you can use the `${password}` variable as either an argument or an environment variable in a snippet. Here's a Bunch with an embedded snippet and appropriate frontmatter:

	```
	---
	from script: mypasswordscript.rb
	---
	
	<<#Password Protected
	- user=ttscoff
	
	___

	---[Password Protected]
	$ mycoolscript.sh ${user}:${password}
	```

	This calls an embedded snippet containing two variables. The variables will be populated by the frontmatter we generated in the Ruby script.

    The snippet calls another shell script with a command line argument containing `user:password`.

    When this Bunch is opened, the Ruby script runs and the password dialog is shown. The result gets added to the frontmatter, which then populates the variables in the snippet.

This is, of course, a fairly silly example, as you could simply add the password request into a script and have it execute something using the password in one line, as opposed to the roundabout method of passing data to the frontmatter through one script and then calling a second script in a snippet. Hopefully it illustrates some possibilities, though.

## Forking Bunches With User Interaction {#forkingbunches}

Bunch offers several methods for creating [interactive Bunches]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/interactivity/), but you can also use a little scripting if you need more flexibility.

You can use AppleScript to display a multiple choice dialog, then act accordingly. This can be used to launch multiple bunches with user interaction.

```applescript
set _res to choose from list {"Comms", "Podcast Record", "Podcast Edit", "Music"} with prompt "What next?" OK button name "Launch" with multiple selections allowed and empty selection allowed

repeat with _bunch in _res
    do shell script "open 'x-bunch-beta://open/" & _bunch & "'"
end repeat
```

Call a script like that within one Bunch, and it can lead to launching other Bunches based on user response.

This strategy can be used with simple yes/no dialogs as well, taking alternate paths based on the response. Any script that can accept user responses via a GUI can use the Bunch [URL handler]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/integration/url-handler) to continue processing Bunches.
