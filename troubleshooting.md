If you're having issues with a Bunch not doing what you expected, consult the [Bunch Log](/bunch/docs/using-bunch/bunch-log) to see if you can trace the issue. If needed, split out sections of a longer Bunch into temporary smaller Bunches and test them one at a time to narrow down any issues.

If you make a change to a Bunch and suddenly your menu is empty, it means that something in the file caused Bunch to crash while reading in your Bunches. If possible, undo that change and use __Preferences->Refresh Bunches__ to attempt to reload.

On rare occasions something really screwy happens and Bunch just stops reading files in the chosen directory. The solution is to change your Bunches Folder using __Preferences->Change Bunches Folder__, then change it right back.

If these steps don't fix the issue, or the issue you're having is not mentioned here, feel free to [contact me](/bunch/docs/support).
